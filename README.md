# employee-attrition-analysis-tableau
Interactive Tableau dashboard analysing key factors influencing employee attrition, including income, salary hikes, job roles, and work experience, to support HR retention and workforce planning decisions.

**Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)**

This project explores factors associated with employee attrition using interactive Tableau dashboards. 
The goal is to understand which employee groups are more likely to leave and which variables may be contributing to higher attrition rates.

**Business Context**

Employee turnover affects team stability, recruitment costs, and productivity. By analysing historical employee data, organisations can identify patterns linked to attrition and take preventive actions such as improving compensation structures, role design, or career progression pathways.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes employee-level information such as:

-Age and gender

-Monthly income and salary hike percentage

-Job role and department

-Number of companies previously worked

-Attrition status

The data was cleaned and grouped within Tableau to support aggregated analysis across different categories.

**Tools and Techniques**

Tableau Desktop
Calculated fields
Filters and parameters
Interactive dashboards
All transformations and visualisations were created directly within Tableau.

**Dashboard Structure**

The dashboard analyses attrition across several dimensions:
Monthly income vs attrition rate
Salary hike vs attrition rate
Job role vs attrition rate
Number of companies worked vs attrition rate
A gender filter allows comparison between different employee groups.

**Observations**

From the dashboard, several patterns can be observed:
Lower income groups show relatively higher attrition rates.
Roles such as Sales Executive and Laboratory Technician display higher attrition compared to other positions.
Smaller salary increases are associated with higher likelihood of attrition.
Employees with frequent job changes tend to have higher attrition rates.
These observations are descriptive and intended to support further investigation rather than establish causation.

**How This Can Be Used**

The dashboard can support HR teams in:
Identifying employee segments with higher turnover risk
Reviewing compensation and promotion policies
Supporting workforce planning and retention strategies
It is designed as an exploratory tool rather than a predictive model.

**How to View the Dashboard**

Download the .twbx file from the tableau-workbook folder.
Open the file using Tableau Desktop or the free Tableau Reader application.

**Dashboard Preview**

Screenshots of the dashboard views are available in the screenshots folder for quick reference.
